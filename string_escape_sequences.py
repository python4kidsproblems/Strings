# Write a program that prints this paragraph correctly, using escape     #
# sequences (look for tabs, newlines etc.):                              #
# '''                                                                    #
# 	Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on    #
# the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped    #
# into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or        #
# conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice    #
# `without pictures or conversation?'                                    #
#                                                                        #
# 	So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for    #
# the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the         #
# pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting #
# up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink     #
# eyes ran close by her.                                                 #
#'''                                                                     #
#                                                                        #
# Copy paste the paragraph to make it easier.                            #
